<p>This is a new policy that IDM is implementing this semester. We would like to begin archiving all student coursework.
We would like all students to document their IDM coursework on sites.bxmc.poly.edu. We want you to archive on
sites.bxmc.poly.edu because these are IDM servers. If your work is archived on your personal servers, there is a
possibility that you would delete your archives after they graduate or even sooner.</p>
<p>If you don’t already have server space, please email Elton Kwok, IDM Technology Director, eltonkwok@nyu.edu,
MAGNET 883, to set up an appointment for space on sites.bxmc.poly.edu.</p></td>
